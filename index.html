		<div> You were attacked by Mother Natue and lost

		<div>Climate War
Climate War the first real world war with homosapiens battleing mother nature for control of the planet Earth.
In this struggle humans are organized into nation's each occupying a piece of Earth some with more advantages than others in the war against Mother Nature. Some have a strategic advantage ( favorable climate etc. others have a resource advantage. The one thing they all have in common is the same adversary, Mother Nature. And in this war Mother Nature has a huge advantage, physics. Hurricanes, floods, droughts,rising oceans, all weapons to be used against an enemy willfully ignorant, clinging to a strategy that never worked and refusing to ally themselves in the coming war.
Not only do you face immediate crises to your country but you are part of a world facing climate change. Your whole world is getting hotter. Some parts are drying out while others are flooding. Deserts are increasing while other areas are flooding. Overall your world is becoming less habitable. Welcome to climate change something humans have done little to try and stop and remain largely defenceless against. In the game as in real life you are at its mercy. 
You can choose three time frames to play. One ends in the year 2025 (5 rounds) . The second ends 2035 (10 rounds) and the third in 2045 (15 rounds). It becomes  harder to survive the longer you play but that is the reality of climate change.   
Your goal is to survive while preserving your resources At the beginning of the game you are assigned a country which you will defend against Mother Nature’s attacks. You have two resources to use defending yourself in the battle, your position i.e. close to a low lying coast line, drought prone areas, etc will determine your risk of being attacked and your wealth, the resources you have with which to fend off MN ‘s attacks. Poor risk prone countries are more vulnerable to loss than rich ones occupying less  risky positions. All of these must  be taken into account when making your one decision, at the beginning of each round, whether or not to ally yourself with other countries in the upcoming battle or go it alone.
Going it alone means that if you get attacked you have to defend yourself; no one will come to your aid and  If you don’t have enough  resources to defend yourself, you will lose the battle and the game will end. If you allied yourself with others they will help when you are attacked by giving resources and although this doesn’t guarantee survival it increases the odds. If you choose to join an alliance you contribute resources to the others defense even though you have not been attacked.  
The game begins with your assignment of a country which you must defend for the entire  game. If you are lucky you will be assigned a rich country with low risk of being attacked ,if you are unlucky, one that is poor and with high risk of being attacked. If semi lucky somewhere in between.
Your first and only choice in each round is whether or not to go it alone or join an alliance.Optimal strategies  for low risk nations with abundant resources may not be the same as for high risk poor nations but as the war progresses your situation could change causing you change your strategy.   
As with all games, luck is a big part of the outcome. You may escape attack all together or if attacked have enough resources to resist and survive but either way each round presents you new challenges and if you're lucky you may survive the climate war but you will certainly be poorer than you began. Remember you are playing against Mother Nature and like the Casino House she always wins in the end.  
Overall climate change is another matter. Since nations have refused to act in the past and individuals have had limited impact, you are almost defenseless against overall climate change. However you can commit some of your resources to overall climates mitigation i.e. greening your country. Unfortunately to be effective others have to change too and they seldom do. To do this in the game click the Climate War button and join the global effort by choosing. The effect in the game is to reduce the chance of a country being attacked. 
There is always the specter of reaching  a tipping point. You may survive but if your world  reaches a tipping point and is destroyed you all go down together. World wide catastrophe occurs when at least 4 countries are destroyed and the world ends. There is  no planet B.
